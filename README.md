## Description

Debug stuff is a simple plugin that allows you to display the transform & colliders of a part in wireframe and display the part Hierarchy in a window. It was created to help understanding how the new legs work.

The window is opened with ALT P and you select an Object by holding shift and moving the cursor over your ship. The dump button will save the content of the window to your log. You can change the current mode between PART, UI and OBJECT. Each one will target specific type of object. The -/+ button limit how far up in the object parent the display goes.
